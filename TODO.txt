1. Implement bidirectional XPC communication
  -the logic contained in ConnectionManager is probably going to need to be refactored somehow...

2. Implement XPC connection interruption/invalidation error handling
  -add ability to interrupt/invalidate XPC connection on demand to demonstrate this

3. Implement running multiple XPC services simultaneously from the same main application
